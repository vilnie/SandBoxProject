				<p>This website is part of my coursework for "Web-sovellusten perusteet" (Fundamentals of Web Applications) at Oulun Ammattikorkeakoulu
					(OAMK), where I'm studying ICT. I had hard time deciding the topic for this website. The idea for was inspired by ChatGPT, a 
					source of creative inspiration that led me to create a it. All the images were also created with AI (Midjourney).<br> <br>
					I created this site as an exploration of various interesting topics, from historical 
					wonders to remarkable achievements. It's a reflection of the skills I've developed during my studies, and it made learning fun.<br> <br>
					Thank you for visiting my project website. I invite you to dive into the world of fascinating facts, figures, and 
					captivating stories. Enjoy your exploration! (Although it's still missing half of the pages)<br><br>
